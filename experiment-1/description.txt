1. The Starting Blocks: <!DOCTYPE html> and <html>  
What it is: Think of this as the very first step.  

What it does:  
<!DOCTYPE html> tells the computer, "Hey, what you're about to read is a webpage."  
<html> is like a big, empty piece of paper where everything else will go.  

2. <head>  
What it is: This is the section behind the scenes.  

What it does: The stuff here isn’t visible on the actual page. It’s information for the web browser, like:  
<title>: This sets the name for the browser tab. In our case, it's "Student Registration Form."  

3. <body>  
What it is: This is the part of the page that everyone can see.  

What it does: Any text, images, or forms you want to show a visitor go inside the <body> tag.  

4. <h2>  
What it is: A heading tag.  

What it does: It makes the text "Student Registration Form" big and bold, like a title on a document. h1 would be even bigger, and h3 would be smaller.  

5. <form>  
What it is: The container for our registration form.  

What it does: This tag groups all our questions and answer boxes together, just like a real-life paper form.  

6. <label>  
What it is: A text label.  

What it does: This is the text that asks the questions, like "Name:", "Email:", and "Age:", so the user knows what to put in each box.  


8. <br>  
What it is: A line break.  

What it does: This is like hitting the "Enter" key on a keyboard. It tells the browser to move down to the next line. We use two (<br><br>) to add a little extra space between the questions to make it easier to read.
