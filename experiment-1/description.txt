The code begins with the <form> tag. This tag creates a form that sends
 ata to /submit using the POST method. This means the information is sent 
 securely. Inside the form, there are three input sections. 

The first section includes a <label> and an <input> with type="text" for 
the user to enter their username. The second section also contains a <label> 
and an <input> with type="email", allowing users to enter a valid email address. 
The third section uses a <label> and a <textarea>, which gives the user a 
large space to type any message or extra information. 

Finally, there is a <input type="submit"> that creates a Submit button. 
When clicked, this button sends all the entered data to the server.
